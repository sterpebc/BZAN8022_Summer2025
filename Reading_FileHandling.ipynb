    "\n",
    "Let's look at the first two lines of the file one character at a time. We'll number each character (starting with 0):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Character Position    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The characters up to position 14 are probably not surprising -- they correspond exactly to what we see on screen. But what's that ⏎ character in position 15? That is a character commonly referred to as `newline`; it's one of the characters in the alphabet of the computer. The `newline` character is how the computer separates one line from the next. If you look above where the 13 lines are displayed, you can see that the `1` in `1,Mon,2` isn't immediately to the right of the `t` in absent -- it's on the next line. That's because right after the `t` in `Absent` there is a `newline` character which means, \"Start a new line now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a program that is displaying text encounters a `newline` character, it knows to start a new line. The program doesn't \"print\" the newline -- you don't see any ⏎ characters on the screen. Instead, the program \"obeys\" the `newline` and starts a new line. We see the effect of the `newline` -- text skips down to the next line -- but we don't see the `newline` itself. Gravity is like this -- we don't see gravity, we just see the effect it has on other things. Same for the wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a file of text on your computer, the file isn't really organized into lines. It's just a stream of characters. What causes all those characters not to display on a single line is that _some_ of the characters are `newlines`.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this relevant to reading from a file? We usually want to read data from a file one line at at a time. If we ask Python to \"read a line,\" Python accomplishes that by reading everything up to the next `newline` it encounters. Python then returns the characters it read as a string."
